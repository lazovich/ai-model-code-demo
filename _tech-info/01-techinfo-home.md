In software development, "model code" or "example code" is a short snippet of real software code that can demonstrates a particular concept. In our AI Model Code, most examples will be written in the Python programming language. Below, you can see specific technical concepts and examples that are linked to the statutes. If you'd like to dive into the model statute, you can find it [here]({{ "/statutes/start/" | relative_url }}). 

### [Evaluating predictive models for disparate performance]({{ "/tech-info/disparities/" | relative_url }})

This section covers how to evaluate a model for disparities across different groups, which is a requirement of [Section 2.1]({{"/statutes/section2.1/" | relative_url}}) of the model statute.

### [Evaluating language models for accuracy and bias]({{ "/tech-info/llm-eval/" | relative_url }})

This section covers techniques for evaluating language models, which require a different set of tools because they are generative rather than discriminative. These techniques can be useful for the requirements in [Section 2.4]({{"/statutes/section2.4/" | relative_url}}).

### [Tools for model documentation]({{"/tech-info/model-docs/" | relative_url }})

This section covers techniques for documenting models, which are useful for several sections, including Sections [2.1]({{"/statutes/section2.1/" | relative_url}}), [2.2]({{"/statutes/section2.2/" | relative_url}}), and [3]({{"/statutes/section3/" | relative_url}}).
