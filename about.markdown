 The AI Model Code seeks to bridge the gap between the legal and technical spheres of artificial intelligence. A resource for <strong>attorneys</strong>, <strong>policymakers</strong>, and <strong>developers</strong>, it connects standardized legal language (a legal "model code" or "model statute") with technical examples of real world implementations of those principles (a programming "model code" or "example code"). While the current iteration is a ***prototype*** and is intended to be a demonstration of what this tool could be, we envision that both the legal and technical resources would be developed through a community-based process, bringing together stakeholders from policy, law, civil society, engineering, and the community.
