* (a) Any first-party developer of an AI system shall be required to do the following:
  * (1)  Internally document the training and evaluation process, specifically:

    * (B) The person(s) responsible for maintenance of the system, and
    * (C) Any risk assessments that have been completed for the system.
  * (2) Conduct rigorous testing of the AI system, specifically:
    * (A) Testing for disparities in performance,
    * (B) Evaluating the system's performance for inputs that do not match the properties of any data on which the system was trained or evaluated ("out of distribution" data), and
    * (C) ...
* (b) The Commission on AI Technology, as defined in [Section 4]({{ "/statutes/section4/" | relative_url }}), shall have the right to examine a first-party developer's compliance with the requirements of Section 2.1(a) as they see fit. If the developer is found to be non-compliant, penalties as defined in [Section 6]({{ "/statutes/section6/" | relative_url }}) can apply. 

#### Committee notes
