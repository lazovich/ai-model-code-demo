Development of AI systems for the following purposes are prohibited[^rationale]:
* (a) Determining a person's race, sex, gender, or sexual orientation,
* (b) Controlling a deadly weapon autonomously,
* (c) Impersonation of an individual, and
* (d) Purposeful generation of disinformation or misinformation.

[^rationale]: The rationale for banning these applications is two-fold. Some, such as in (a), are scientifically unsound applications of AI technology. Others, like (b)-(d), have the potential to inflict large-scale bodily or psychological harms on an individual.
