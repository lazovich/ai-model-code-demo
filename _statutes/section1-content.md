The following terms are defined for use throughout the remainder of this document:
* (a) an "**artificial intelligence**" or "AI" system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.  Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action[^ai-def];
* (b) a "**first-party developer**" is any legal person with direct involvement in the design, coding, training, or other development of an AI system[^first-party-def];
* (c) a "**third-party procurer**" is any legal person that purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires an AI system from a first-party developer;
* (d) a "**sensitive application**" is the use of AI to determine eligibility or otherwise furnish a legal person with goods or services related to housing, healthcare, financial services, or employment;
* (e) a "**model**" is any computational object that takes in data and outputs a result based on data that it has previously observed;
* (f) "**training**" is the process of using a dataset to learn the parameters or otherwise build a model;
* (g) a "**training dataset**" is any collection of data that is used to train a model;

[^ai-def]: The definition of artificial intelligence is taken from the Biden administration's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence ([EO 14110](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/)).
[^first-party-def]: First-party developers do not include entities that acquire datasets that are used by other entities for training models.
