In the legal realm, a "model code" or "restatement" is an exemplary set of language that can be used and adopted by different jurisdictions. Because of the unique and changing nature of AI, we felt the need to build such model statutes for AI regulation that are also grounded in the real world experiences of both the users and developers of these systems.
