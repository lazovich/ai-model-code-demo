* (a) Any {% glossary third-party procurer %} of an AI system from a {% glossary first-party developer %} must verify that:
  * (1) The AI system is suitable for the application for which the procurer intends to use the system, and
  * (2) That the system has been tested by the first-party developer in situations sufficiently similar to those to which the system will be applied[^test-note].
* (b) The requirements of section 3(a) do not apply when:
  * (1) The first-party developer has made an explicit warranty regarding the performance and applicability of the system to the procurer's use case[^warranty-note], or
  * (2) The first-party developer agrees to assume the risk of any harms that may arise from the application of the system. 

[^test-note]: This verification can be as simple as ensuring that the intended use case is one that the first-party developer advertises or otherwise puts forward that its system can handle. 

[^warranty-note]: Such warranties can be made in advertising material, websites, sales contracts, published model cards, or other documentation regarding the system being procured.
