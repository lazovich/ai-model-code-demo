* (a) False or misleading claims regarding the capabilities of an AI system shall be considered a deceptive act or practice under applicable federal or state consumer protection law. 
* (b) If an AI system itself engages in a deceptive act or practice, any and all first-party developers of the system shall be held jointly and severally liable for any harms that result from the practice. 

#### Committee notes
* (1) An example of 2.4(b) would be an AI customer support chatbot giving a customer incorrect information about their ability to obtain a refund. The parent company is to be held liable in the same way they would if a human support agent gave the incorrect information.
